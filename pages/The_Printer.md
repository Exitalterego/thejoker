The Joker is a modified V-Core 3 500 3D printer, originally designed by Ratrig. It utilises a CoreXY motion system to allow for increased X and Y movement speeds, and has its print bed on the Z-axis to limit the mass that is being moved in lateral directions. More information on the specifics of the V-Core 3 can be found here.

The printer itself utilises RatOS as its command software. This is a modified version Klipper firware customised to allow software updates without overiding printer specific settings. Klipper runs in colaboration with Moonraker, an API to expose printer settings and information, and Mainsail which provides the web based front-end interface.
